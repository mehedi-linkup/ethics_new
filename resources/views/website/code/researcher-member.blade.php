                    <p>
                    PRINCIPLE 1: ETHICAL CONDUCT
Ethical conduct in research involves upholding the fundamental principles of respect, integrity, fairness, and responsibility. Research ethics committees play a vital role in ensuring that research projects adhere to ethical standards by reviewing protocols, assessing risks and benefits to participants, and monitoring ongoing studies. Researchers, on the other hand, must obtain informed consent from participants, protect their privacy and confidentiality, and minimize any potential harm or risks. Ethical conduct also entails disclosing any conflicts of interest and adhering to ethical guidelines and regulations established by governing bodies. By prioritizing ethical conduct, research contributes to the advancement of knowledge while respecting the rights and well-being of individuals involved.
Component 1: Obtaining Informed Consent from Participants
Explanation: Obtaining informed consent from participants is a fundamental ethical requirement in research. Informed consent ensures that participants are fully aware of the nature, purpose, risks, and benefits of their involvement in the research study. It empowers participants to make voluntary and autonomous decisions about whether to participate, based on a clear understanding of what their involvement entails. Informed consent also demonstrates respect for participants' autonomy, rights, and dignity, and it helps to establish trust between researchers and participants.
Indicators for Ethical Research Practices: 
(i) Clarity of Consent Form:
•	The consent form should clearly outline the purpose of the study, the procedures involved, and any potential risks or benefits to participants.
•	Ensure that the language used in the consent form is easily understandable to the target population, avoiding technical jargon or complex terminology.
•	Include contact information for the researcher or research team, as well as information about participants' rights and how to withdraw consent.
Instructions for Use of Indicators: Researchers and research ethics committees can use the following instructions to assess the clarity of the consent form:
•	Review the consent form to ensure that it contains all necessary information, including the purpose of the study, procedures involved, and potential risks and benefits.
