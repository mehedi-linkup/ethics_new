                    </div>

                    <p>The ETHICS® Code for Researchers provides a comprehensive guide outlining the principles and standards governing ethical research conduct. Research ethics committees and researchers are instrumental in upholding the integrity, transparency, and credibility of scientific inquiry. This code serves as a roadmap for maintaining ethical values and best practices throughout the research process, from project inception to the dissemination of findings. By adhering to these principles, research aims to uphold respect for human dignity, ensure participant welfare, and contribute to societal betterment through the advancement of knowledge. The following is the explanation of each of the six grounding principles of this ETHICS® Code for Researchers. </p>

                    <h2>Ethical Conduct:</h2>
                   
                    <p>Ethical conduct in research involves upholding the fundamental principles of respect, integrity, fairness, and responsibility. Research ethics committees play a vital role in ensuring that research projects adhere to ethical standards by reviewing protocols, assessing risks and benefits to participants, and monitoring ongoing studies. Researchers, on the other hand, must obtain informed consent from participants, protect their privacy and confidentiality, and minimize any potential harm or risks. Ethical conduct also entails disclosing any conflicts of interest and adhering to ethical guidelines and regulations established by governing bodies. By prioritizing ethical conduct, research contributes to the advancement of knowledge while respecting the rights and well-being of individuals involved. </p>
