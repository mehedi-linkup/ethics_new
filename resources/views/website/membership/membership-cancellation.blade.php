                    <p>ETHICS upholds stringent standards of ethical conduct among its members to ensure the integrity and credibility of scholarly publishing. In cases where a member fails to adhere to these standards, ETHICS reserves the right to cancel their membership. Various provisions outline the circumstances under which membership cancellation may occur:</p>
                
                    <p>Violation of ETHICS® Code FOR Publishers: The ETHICS® Code for Publishers outlines a comprehensive set of ethical guidelines and best practices in scholarly publishing. Violations of this code may include instances of plagiarism, data fabrication or falsification, copyright infringement, authorship disputes, or any other unethical behavior. These violations undermine the integrity and trustworthiness of published research and may lead to membership cancellation.</p>
                
                    <p>Breach of Contract: Membership with ETHICS® entails a contractual agreement between the organization and its members. This agreement typically includes terms and conditions regarding ethical conduct, payment of membership fees, compliance with publishing standards, and other obligations. A breach of any of these contractual terms may result in membership cancellation.</p>
                
                    <p>Ethical Complaints: ETHICS® takes ethical complaints from authors, editors, reviewers, or other relevant stakeholders seriously. Complaints may arise due to allegations of unethical behavior, such as plagiarism, poor peer review practices, improper authorship attribution, or conflicts of interest. Upon receiving a complaint, ETHICS® conducts a thorough investigation to determine the validity of the allegations. If the complaint is substantiated, membership cancellation may be considered as a disciplinary measure.</p>
                
                    <p>Non-Payment of Dues: Members are required to pay their membership dues within the specified time frame as outlined by ETHICS®. These dues contribute to the operation and maintenance of the organization, including the development of ethical guidelines, provision of member services, and administration of complaint resolution processes. Failure to fulfill this financial obligation may result in membership cancellation.</p>
                    <p>Repeated Ethical Infractions: In some cases, a member may demonstrate a pattern of ethical misconduct or infractions over time. Despite warnings or corrective actions, if the member continues to engage in unethical behavior, ETHICS® may deem it necessary to cancel their membership. This decision is made to uphold the organization's commitment to ethical publishing practices and maintain the trust of the scholarly community in ETHICS®-certified publications.</p>
                    <p>Overall, membership cancellation by ETHICS® is a serious matter that is undertaken with careful consideration and adherence to due process. The organization strives to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in all disciplinary actions while upholding the highest standards of ethical conduct in scholarly publishing.</p>
